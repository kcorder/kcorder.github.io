# What's Next for RL? 

RL has seen many significant advances in the past few years, mostly as a result of deep learning advances. However, many large hurdles remain. In this post, I give my shortlist of (the long list of) *large* advances that I hope to see in research. 

1. Efficiently re-using memory 
  - cite MERLIN, neural Turing machines, and other RL with LSTM works. 
1. Significant model-based learning (approximate modeling) 
  - People are excellent at transfer learning, likely because we have experience and can expect our actions to have certain outcomes. 
  - Advances in quickly learning the model of the world, and how it relates to past experience of similar worlds, is essential for fast learning.
