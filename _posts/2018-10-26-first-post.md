Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.

Maff: $\int x = \frac{x^2}{2}$

Another (in display):  

$$ \int x = y $$

Code example here: 

```python
import random 
n = random.randint(10)

class A(other): 
    def __init__(self): 
        super(A, self).__init__() 
```

please work
