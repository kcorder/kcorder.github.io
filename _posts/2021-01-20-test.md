## Multi-Agent Actor Critic with Generative Inference

$$H(X) = \color{blue}{-}\sum_i \color{red}{p_i} \cdot \color{blue}{\log_2 p_i} = \sum_i \color{red}{p_i} \cdot \color{blue}{\log_2 \frac{1}{p_i}}$$ 

```python
def entropy(P):
    total = 0 
    for prob in P:
        total += prob*log(prob)
    return -total 
```
